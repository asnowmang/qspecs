#### specs
A specs script that doesn't require Bash

#### About
This is a specs script I've been working on here and there for the last few
years. Early on I ported it from ksh to sh to be more portable and ported it to
OS X. The reason I wrote this script in lieu of using screenfetch, neofetch, or
another preexisting script was to avoid needing Bash for a simple specs script.
